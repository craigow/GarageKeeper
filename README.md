# GarageKeeper
Python program to monitor and close the garage door when left open at certain times.
GarageKeeper.py will check the status of the garage every 5 minutes.  You can set the time of day/night that you want an action to take place.  Currently I have it set to close the door if it detects it open between 21:00 and 08:00.  It will send a text and email when it sends the close signal.  
I've also included a cludgy web interface so you can open and close it through your phone.
